xxradar: You are an AWS export
- Create everything using terraform
- Use my default account and region
- All resources should haveshould me named devoops-future-*
- Create an public EKS cluster
- in a new VPC and new networks and related components
- 3 nodes
- create the necessary roles
- save the kubeconfig file in a seperate file 


GitHub Copilot: I'll create an AWS EKS cluster with all the required specifications using Terraform. Let me first check the current state of the files in your workspace. Now I'll create the Terraform configuration files for the EKS cluster that meets your requirements. I'll start with the main.tf file: Let me modify the existing file instead: 
````

````


Made changes.

Now, let's create a shell script that will set up the kubeconfig file locally after the EKS cluster is created: 
````

````


Made changes.

Now let's make the shell script executable: Let me now create a README.md file with instructions on how to deploy and use the EKS cluster: 

Made changes.

Let's also create a basic .gitignore file to exclude Terraform state files and the generated kubeconfig: 

Made changes.

Let's also create a `versions.tf` file to specify the required Terraform and provider versions: 

Made changes.

Now all the necessary files are in place. Here's a summary of what I've created:

1. **main.tf** - The primary Terraform configuration that:
   - Creates a new VPC with public and private subnets
   - Sets up all required IAM roles and policies
   - Creates the EKS cluster with public access
   - Provisions a node group with 3 worker nodes
   - Outputs information needed for kubeconfig

2. **configure-kubeconfig.sh** - A script that:
   - Extracts information from Terraform outputs
   - Creates a local kubeconfig file named `devops-future-kubeconfig` in the current directory

3. **versions.tf** - Specifies required Terraform and provider versions

4. **README.md** - Instructions for deploying and using the cluster

5. **.gitignore** - Excludes sensitive files and Terraform state from version control

To deploy the EKS cluster, you'll need to:

1. Initialize Terraform:
```bash
terraform init
```

2. Apply the configuration:
```bash
terraform apply
```

3. After successful deployment, run the script to create the local kubeconfig file:
```bash
./configure-kubeconfig.sh
```

4. Use the generated kubeconfig to interact with your cluster:
```bash
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/devops-future-kubeconfig
kubectl get nodes
```

The EKS cluster will be publicly accessible, deployed in a new VPC with appropriate networking, and will have 3 worker nodes as requested. All resources are named with the "devops-future-" prefix as specified.
```
